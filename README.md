# Beat-On
As a part of learning to code ,I builded a project that involved creating a personalised music steaming platform.The layout and design had been inspired from various popular steaming platforms like Spotify,Jio savvn and Apple Music. 
The platform is responsive and user friendly that allows users to play music.HTML5 and CSS was used for design and style the interface,while Javascript was implemented to handle user input and basic interactions such as playback controls-play,pause and next.Font-awesome has been used for the play/pause buttons and images has been derived from unsplash.Whilw developing the platform i also gained experience in tools such as Git and Github.  

## Tech-Stack
*HTML5
*CSS
*Javascript

## Features
* The user can start or pause the playing of the currently chosen track using the play/pause button.
* The Next/Previous buttons allow the user to move to the playlist's or album's next or previous track.
* By sliding a slider or clicking on a progress bar, Seek lets users manually forward or rewind a track.
* Display the album cover and the song that is now playing.

## Usage
When the Spotify clone is open in your browser, you can play a song by clicking the play button next to it. You can then adjust the song's playback using the controls at the bottom of the page.The "Now Playing" section at the bottom of the page features artwork for the album and the song that is currently playing.
